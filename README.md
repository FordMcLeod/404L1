# Lab 1 for Web apps

q1
Link to my github page:  https://www.github.com/FordMcLeod
q2
Version 2.9.1 is installed on the system. 
q3
2.21.0, which is a more recent version of requests. This is because I'm working on one of the lab machines.
q4
The script prints out different versions, because each system has different versions of requests installed which the script utilized.
q5 
Status code 301 is returned. This is because it's redirecting us to http://www.google.com.
To get a 200 error code we must curl http://www.google.com so there isn't a redirect.
q6
The status code of 200 is returned. It's the result of curl -iL.
q7 
When we used -X POST it changed from a pull to post, and it fills in form contents.
